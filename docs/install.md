Install
=======

For small and medium NeoDB instances, it's recommended to deploy as a container cluster with Docker Compose. To run a large instance, please see [scaling up](configuration.md#scaling-parameters) for some tips.

## Install docker compose

Follow [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to install Docker Compose if you haven't already.

Please verify its version is 2.x or higher before the next step:

```
docker compose version
```

The rest of this doc assumes you can run docker commands without `sudo`, to verify that:

```
docker run --rm hello-world
```

Follow [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) if it's not enabled, or use `sudo` to run commands in this doc.


## Prepare configuration files
 - create a folder for configuration, e.g. `~/mysite/config`
 - grab `compose.yml` and `neodb.env.example` from [latest release](https://github.com/neodb-social/neodb/releases)
 - rename `neodb.env.example` to `.env`


## Set up .env file and web root
Change essential options like `NEODB_SITE_DOMAIN` in `.env` before starting the cluster for the first time. Changing them later may have unintended consequences, please make sure they are correct before exposing the service externally.

- `NEODB_SITE_DOMAIN` - domain name of your site
- `NEODB_SECRET_KEY` - encryption key of session data
- `NEODB_DATA` is the path to store db/media/cache, it's `../data` by default, but can be any path that's writable
- `NEODB_DEBUG` - set to `False` for production deployment

Optionally:

- `NEODB_ADMIN_HANDLES` - auto-promote users to superuser on registration by matching handle, in `type:handle` format (e.g. `mastodon:user@mastodon.social,email:admin@example.com`). Supported types: `mastodon`, `email`, `bluesky`, `threads`.
- `robots.txt` and `logo.png` may be placed under `$NEODB_DATA/www-root/`.

Site name, preferred languages, and other customization options can be configured later through the Site Settings UI at `/manage/`.

See [neodb.env.example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neodb-social/neodb/main/neodb.env.example) and [configuration](configuration.md) for more options.


## Start container

In the folder with `compose.yml` and `.env`, run:
```
docker compose --profile production pull
docker compose --profile production up -d
```

Starting up for the first time might take a few minutes depending on download speed. Use the following commands for status and logs:
```
docker compose ps
docker compose --profile production logs -f
```

In a few seconds, the site should be up at 127.0.0.1:8000. You may check it with:
```
curl http://localhost:8000/nodeinfo/2.0/
```

JSON response will be returned if the server is up and running:
```
{"version": "2.0", "software": {"name": "neodb", "version": "0.8-dev"}, "protocols": ["activitypub", "neodb"], "services": {"outbound": [], "inbound": []}, "usage": {"users": {"total": 1}, "localPosts": 0}, "openRegistrations": true, "metadata": {}}
```


## Make the site available publicly

The next step is to expose `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to the external network as `https://yourdomain.tld` (NeoDB requires `https`). There are many ways to do it, you may use nginx or caddy as a reverse proxy server with an SSL cert configured, or configure a tunnel provider like cloudflared to do the same. Once done, you may check it with:

```
curl https://yourdomain.tld/nodeinfo/2.0/
```

You should see the same JSON response as above, and the site is now accessible to the public.


## Register an account and make it admin

Open `https://yourdomain.tld` in your browser and register an account. If `NEODB_ADMIN_HANDLES` is configured, the account will be auto-promoted to superuser on registration. Otherwise, assuming the username is `admin`, run the following command to make it a superuser:

```
docker compose --profile production run --rm shell neodb-manage user --super admin
```

Take a look at [Manage Accounts](accounts.md) for more information.

## Add sample catalog items (optional)

A new instance has an empty catalog. To fill it with a small set of well known books, albums, games, films and TV shows:

```
docker compose --profile production run --rm shell neodb-manage seed_catalog --wait
```

This fetches 90 items and takes several minutes. `--wait` holds until the queued jobs for related items, such as seasons and people, are done. Use `--type book,album,game,movie,tv` to load one category only, and `--force` to fetch everything again. The command is safe to run more than one time.

Each category needs the API key for its source in `.env`: `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for books, `IGDB_API_CLIENT_ID` and `IGDB_API_CLIENT_SECRET` for games, and `TMDB_API_V3_KEY` for films and TV shows. See [Configuration](configuration.md) for these keys. Albums come from MusicBrainz and need no key.

## What now?
Now your instance should be ready to serve. More tweaks are available, see [Configuration](configuration.md) for options.
