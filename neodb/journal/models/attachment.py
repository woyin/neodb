"""Registry of user-uploaded files embedded in journal content.

Every upload that ends up inside a markdown body (Article / Review /
Collection brief) or attached to a Note gets a row here, so the site can
answer "which files does this user own", "which pieces use this file" and
"what can be reclaimed when an account is deleted" -- none of which is
answerable from a bare URL sitting in a markdown body.

Registration happens *before* the URL is embedded: the upload endpoints
(``journal.views.common.upload_image`` and the ``/api/me/attachment/``
API) create the row and hand back its URL, and saving the piece links the
row to it via :func:`link_attachments_to_piece`.

Note attachments arrive from the other direction -- they are uploaded to
takahe through the Mastodon API, not to us -- so :meth:`Attachment.sync_from_post`
copies media from *local* posts into our own storage (duplication is
intentional: takahe hard-prunes posts, and the copy is what keeps the note
renderable afterwards). Media on remote posts is never downloaded; it gets
a pointer row carrying the URLs takahe already serves it under, mirroring
how takahe's own ``PostAttachment`` represents media it has not cached.

The legacy ``Note.attachments`` JSON is still the fallback read path while
the async backfill runs; :attr:`Note.attachment_list` prefers rows and the
column can be dropped once every deployment's backfill has completed.
