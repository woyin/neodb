"""Drag-to-sort registration captcha.

A visitor who has verified an identity but not yet picked a username is shown
a set of item covers and two category rows, and must drag each cover into the
row it belongs to. Passing needs both a correct sort and interaction telemetry
consistent with a person moving a pointer.

Deliberate constraints, each load-bearing:

- Only opaque per-challenge tokens reach the client. Item pks, uuids, titles
  and category names stay server side, so a tile cannot be resolved back to a
  catalog entry from the page.
- Covers carry no title text. A title is a search key: the public catalog
  search returns an item's category for any title, so showing one would hand
  the answer over.
- The whole step shares one time budget and a fixed number of regenerations;
  see ``CAPTCHA_TTL`` and ``CAPTCHA_MAX_REGENERATIONS``.

The module mirrors ``users.login_proof``: tunables live at module level so
tests can relax them, and state lives in the session rather than in a signed
client payload.

    Normalization is a security requirement, not cosmetics: cover paths are
    ``item/<category>/...`` and shapes differ by category (square album art,
    2:3 posters, tall book covers, landscape box art), so an un-normalized tile
    leaks the answer through its dimensions and mime type just as plainly as
    through its URL.

    The cover is stretched to fill the square, and the alternatives were both
    worse:

    - fitting and padding keeps the shape perfectly readable. Flat bars have a
      measurable bounding box, so a bot recovers the aspect ratio, and with it
      the category, without looking at the picture at all.
    - cropping to a square hides the shape too, but with no title beneath it a
      crop that takes the top off a book cover can leave the tile unanswerable.

    Stretching distorts a little and leaves no geometry to measure: every tile
    is the same full-bleed square with all of the cover still visible. A person
    reads a squashed poster as a poster; a bot has to classify the image.

    The transform is also jittered per challenge. A fixed one would be exactly
    reproducible: the anonymous catalog search hands out an item's cover URL
    alongside its category, so a crawler could run this pipeline over the
    catalog and match each tile by checksum, recovering everything the tokens
    hide.

    Be honest about what the jitter buys. It draws from a bounded set --
    CAPTCHA_TILE_JITTER_PX crop insets times the quality range -- so it does
    not make matching impossible; it multiplies the precompute an attacker
    needs by the size of that set, and it costs nothing on our side. It does
    not touch perceptual hashing at all, which no amount of jitter would. On a
    flat, detail-free cover it may produce identical bytes across challenges,
    which is fine: such a cover identifies nothing in the first place.
